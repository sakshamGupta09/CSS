# Why flexbox

- To place collection of items in a row or a column (1D layout).
- To control spacing between the items.

## Navigation

- We have links in a horizontal navbar.
- We might end up with some additional space left after placing the items.
- We can use the extra space around the items using `justify-content` or we can grow the size of links to take up the extra space.

## Split navigation

- To create a left group and right group of items.
- Using `margin: auto`
